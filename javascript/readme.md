lucky number seven kata
===

who doesn't like the number seven?!

we discovered something interesting. some numbers can magically be reduced to number seven.

don’t you have the necessity to know which ones they are? we definitely do! and we thought it might be interesting to iterate solutions to that.

enjoy ;7

# the kata

you need to write a function that figures out all numbers in a given range, that match the following criteria: each figure in a number is summed and compared if the sum equals the number seven.

### example

the number *25343* is an interesting one because the sum of each digit is *25*. when each digit is summed again, it results in the number seven.

also *43*, *6001*, and so on.

in other words: if the recursive sum of each digit of a number results in the number seven, that is the number we are looking for.
